❌ **Navigation inconsistency** - different patterns for auth/unauth users  
❌ **Content hierarchy confusion** - marketing mixed with learning content  
❌ **Poor feature discoverability** - key features buried in navigation  
❌ **Mobile navigation complexity** - too many nested menu items

## 📊 User Journey Analysis

### **Current User Journeys (Problematic)**

#### **New User Journey (Confusing)**
```
Landing Page → ??? → Dashboard (marketing content) → ??? → Course enrollment → ??? → Learning
```
**Problems**: Multiple unclear decision points, mixed content types, no clear progression

#### **Returning Student Journey (Inefficient)**
```
Dashboard → Navigate through marketing content → Find course → Find current lesson
```
**Problems**: Too many clicks, cognitive load from irrelevant content

#### **Evidence Seeker Journey (Hidden)**
```
Dashboard → Evidence (if they find it) → Limited public access
```
**Problems**: Evidence library not prominently featured for public users

### **Proposed User Journeys (Optimized)**

#### **New User Journey (Clear)**
```
Landing → Programs → Course Details → Sign Up → Student Hub → Learning
```
**Benefits**: Clear progression, focused content at each step

#### **Returning Student Journey (Direct)**
```
Direct to Student Hub → Current Progress → Next Lesson → Learning
```
**Benefits**: Immediate access to relevant content, minimal clicks

#### **Evidence Seeker Journey (Prominent)**
```
Landing → Evidence Library → Study Details → Sign Up (if valuable)
```
**Benefits**: Evidence as primary public feature, clear value proposition
